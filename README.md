# Sparkify - A Music Streaming Platform Data Warehouse Project

## Introduction

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown its user base and song database and wants to move its processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, and a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

The aim of this project is to build an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for the analytics team to continue finding insights into what songs their users are listening to. We will execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.

## Datasets

- **Song data**: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
- **Log data**: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`
- **Log metadata**: `s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json`

Note: The `udacity-dend` bucket is in the `us-west-2` region. Specify the region using the `REGION` keyword in the `COPY` command if wer Redshift cluster is in a different region.

### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID.

Example:
```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

Sample content:
```json
{
    "num_songs": 1,
    "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7",
    "artist_latitude": null,
    "artist_longitude": null,
    "artist_location": "",
    "artist_name": "Line Renaud",
    "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1",
    "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff",
    "duration": 152.92036,
    "year": 0
}
```

### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by an event simulator. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

Example:
```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

### Log JSON Metadata

The `log_json_path.json` file specifies the structure of the JSON data, allowing Redshift to properly parse and load it into the staging tables.

## Schema for Song Play Analysis

Using the song and event datasets, we'll create a star schema optimized for song play analysis.

### Fact Table

**songplays** - records in event data associated with song plays (i.e., records with page `NextSong`)
- songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

### Dimension Tables

- **users** - users in the app
  - user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
- **songs** - songs in music database
  - song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
- **artists** - artists in music database
  - artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
- **time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
  - start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## Project Template

The project template includes four files:

1. `create_table.py`: Create wer fact and dimension tables for the star schema in Redshift.
2. `etl.py`: Load data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and then process that data into wer analytics tables on Redshift.
3. `sql_queries.py`: Define wer SQL statements, which will be imported into the two other files.
4. `README.md`: Provide discussion on wer process and decisions for this ETL pipeline.

## Project Steps

### Create Table Schemas

1. Design schemas for wer fact and dimension tables.
2. Write a SQL `CREATE` statement for each table in `sql_queries.py`.
3. Complete the logic in `create_tables.py` to connect to the database and create these tables.
4. Write SQL `DROP` statements to drop tables in the beginning of `create_tables.py` to reset the database for testing.
5. Launch a Redshift cluster and create an IAM role with read access to S3.
6. Add Redshift database and IAM role info to `dwh.cfg`.
7. Test by running `create_tables.py` and checking the table schemas in wer Redshift database.

### Build ETL Pipeline

1. Implement the logic in `etl.py` to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift.
2. Implement the logic in `etl.py` to load data from staging tables to analytics tables on Redshift.
3. Test by running `etl.py` after running `create_tables.py` and running analytic queries on wer Redshift database.
4. Delete wer Redshift cluster when finished.

## Note

- The `SERIAL` command in Postgres is not supported in Redshift. Use `IDENTITY(0,1)` instead.
- Many of the issues we may encounter will be related to security, such as incorrect keys, roles, or region settings. Make sure we can accomplish tasks such as setting up a Redshift cluster, implementing a role, and creating a virtual network before attempting the project.
